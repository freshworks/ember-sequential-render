    description: 'Stunning is one of the most useful spells in the wizard’s arsenal. It renders the victim unconscious. The effects of the Stunning Spell may be counteracted by ‘Rennervate’, but will also wear off with time on their own. Another method of avoiding the spell is to deflect it with a Shield Charm'

The Patronus then acts as a shield, with Dementors feeding on it rather than the wizard himself. The spell also has another use, devised by Dumbledore. He invented a way of using the Patronus to deliver messages'
